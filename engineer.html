                    The roles and responsibilities of engineers can vary depending on their specific field of expertise and the industry they work in. However, there are some common roles and responsibilities that are generally associated with engineers across various disciplines. Here are some key roles and responsibilities:
                    <ul class="cgtext"style="top:137%">
                        <li>One of the primary roles of engineers is to identify problems or challenges and find effective and efficient solutions.</li><br>
                        <li>Engineers conduct thorough analysis and testing of materials, components, and systems to ensure they meet required specifications and performance standards.</li><br>
                        <li> Engineers often lead or participate in project teams, where they plan, organize, and manage the execution of engineering projects.</li><br>
                        <li>Engineers work in multidisciplinary teams, collaborating with other professionals, such as architects, scientists, and technicians.</li><br>
                        <li> Engineers must adhere to safety standards and government regulations to ensure that their designs and projects are safe for public use and do not harm the environment.</li><br>
