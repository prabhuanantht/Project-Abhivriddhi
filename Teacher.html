                    The primary role of a teacher is to deliver classroom instruction to help students learn. A teacher is someone who provides assistance in learning life as well as educational skills. In a career as teacher, he or she plans a curriculum to provide lessons in the class depending on the student’s grade level. A teacher is a professional who is less likely to lose his or her temper with students. He or she keeps patience in teaching students and answers each student’s questions until their doubts are not cleared.
